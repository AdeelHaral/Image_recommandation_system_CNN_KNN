Image Recommendation System Readme

This repository contains an Image Recommendation System that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image training and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for finding the nearest images. The system is integrated into a Streamlit web application.

Files in the Repository:
Image_Recommendation_System.ipynb:

This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for training the image recommendation system using CNN.
It uses a dataset to train the CNN model for image recognition.
Additionally, KNN is applied to find the nearest images based on feature embeddings.
app.py:

The Streamlit web application is written in this Python script.
It integrates the trained model and KNN functionality to recommend images.
Instructions for Usage:
Training the Model:

Open and run the Image_Recommendation_System.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
This notebook trains the CNN model on the provided dataset.
Running the Streamlit App:

Ensure you have Streamlit installed (pip install streamlit).
Run the Streamlit app using the command: streamlit run app.py.
Access the application through the provided local URL.
Interacting with the App:

Once the app is running, upload an image using the provided interface.
The system will recommend visually similar images based on the trained model and KNN.
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Streamlit
Scikit-learn
Other necessary libraries (specified in requirements.txt)
Note:
Make sure to replace the placeholder dataset in the Image_Recommendation_System.ipynb with your desired dataset.
Ensure that you have the required libraries installed by running pip install.

Feel free to explore and enhance the functionalities of the Image Recommendation System. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please raise an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
